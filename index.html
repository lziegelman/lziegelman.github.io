<p> Hi, my name is Liran and I completed my PhD in computational neuroscience at the University of Illinois in May 2024. I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of data-focused projects across the years. I've shared some of my favorites here. While I love working with biological data, I'm happy to consult on a variety of data types. For statistical, machine learning, or data processing, email <strong>liran.ziegelman@gmail.com</strong> for rates and availability. </p>
