title: About Me
---

<p>Hi, my name is Liran and I'm the founder of Peridot Data Consulting. I grew up in Kansas and had my first exposure to statistics as a freshman in college, where I discovered my joy for methods, much to my surprise. I completed a BS in behavioral neuroscience with a minor in social & behavioral sciences methodology at the University of Kansas while conducting research in nutritional neuroscience. I then went on to work at Illinois in the field of neuromechanics, a field combining motor neuroscience and biomechanics, as a PhD student in computational neuroscience. I also worked as a teaching assistant for a graduate level statistics course for five years of my time at the University of Illinois. Once I graduated in May 2024, I began looking for new challenges.</p>
