title: About Me
---


<p>Hi, my name is Liran and I'm the founder of Peridot Data Consulting. I grew up in Kansas and had my first exposure to statistics as a freshman in college, where I discovered my joy for methods, much to my surprise. I completed a BS in behavioral neuroscience with a minor in social & behavioral sciences methodology at the University of Kansas while conducting research in nutritional neuroscience. I then went on to work at Illinois in the field of neuromechanics, a field combining motor neuroscience and biomechanics, as a PhD student in computational neuroscience. I also worked as a teaching assistant for a graduate level statistics course for five years of my time at the University of Illinois. Once I graduated in May 2024, I began looking for new challenges. I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of data-focused projects across the years. I've shared some of my favorites here. While I love working with biological data, I'm happy to consult on a variety of data types. </p>

<p>Hi, my name is Liran and I'm a quantitative researcher. I have a PhD in computational neuroscience and I specialize in in working with data from its raw form to the creation of final insights. I have previous experience in descriptive statistics, tests of mean and variance, regression & ANOVA modeling (and other GLM), non-linear & time series modeling, latent variable analyses like confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, and machine learning methods from the old to the new. I also love working on data preprocessing or transformation. While biological and human data is my specialty, I've never met data I didn't enjoy working with. I enjoy working with challenging data, look forward to the frustratations of troubleshooting code, and live for being able to deliver results. I've worked in Python, R, Matlab, SAS, Java, and HTML. While I have my favorite tools, I also love picking up new ones and am happy to be asked to do so as part of my job.</p>
