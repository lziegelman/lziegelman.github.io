The final stage of my dissertation work asked the question of whether we could use machine learning (ML) to classify the control strategy that a person uses to move their hand (prioritizing speed or range of motion) at any given time. After breaking down the question into components, I ended up with needing to define the input and output for the ML model, as well as which ML model is a best fit for a question of this type.

1. Input: What should go into the model

2. Output: What should come out of the model

3. Model Design: What type of ML model and architecture would support successfully asking this question
