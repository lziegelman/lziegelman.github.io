We're able to take advantage of a powerful relationship between heart rate variability (HRV) and anxiety. Essentially, as our level of anxiety increases, our sympathetic system kicks in to regulate our heart rate, which provides us with less variability from heart beat to beat. When our anxiety decreases, the input from our parasympathetic system becomes more powerful and slows our heart rate down, as well as resulting in a higher variability from beat to beat. While the relationship between each person's resting, calm, and anxious heart rate is very individual, the HRV for each of those states is much more reliable. This means that if we can effectively calculate HRV, we have a clear, quantifiable metric of anxiety. HRV as a single metric of anxiety allows us to create simple and responsive tools for consumers and patients.

The interesting question arises when we actually look at our HRV data. The reality is that if a person is moving when we collect their data, we introduce a lot of noise. As we prioritize more affordable sensors, we also sacrifice the quality of our data. This means that we need to figure out how to filter, clean, and transform our data to effectively capture each heart beat and therefore calculate HRV.
